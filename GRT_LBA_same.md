## 🔬 LBA Confirms and Extends Your GRT Conclusions

### ❌ LBA CONFIRMS: Violation of Perceptual Separability
* **GRT Evidence:** Statistical violations in choice patterns.
* **LBA Evidence:** Strong correlation (`-0.568`) between left and right biases.

**What this means:**
* **If separable:** Perception of the left line shouldn't affect perception of the right line.
* **LBA shows:** People with strong left biases also tend to have strong (but opposite) right biases.
* **Example: Subject 35** systematically avoids reporting `|` on both sides.
    * Left bias: `-0.305` (sees `|` as `\`)
    * Right bias: `+0.451` (sees `|` as `/`)
    * **Result:** Almost never reports the `| |` combination.

### ❌ LBA CONFIRMS: Violation of Perceptual Independence
* **GRT Evidence:** Correlated errors across left/right dimensions.
* **LBA Evidence:** Coordinated bias patterns and multiplicative choice integration.

**Specific violations in your data:**
* **Choice combination effects:** `predicted_choice = left_decision × 2 + right_decision`
* **Non-random patterns:** Subject 36 severely underuses `||` (5%) but overuses diagonal combinations.
* **Systematic coordination:** When the left channel is biased, the right channel often compensates.

### 🚀 LBA EXTENDS Beyond GRT

1.  **Mechanism Explanation:**
    * **GRT:** "Violations exist."
    * **LBA:** "**Here's HOW they work**" - dual evidence accumulators race to a threshold.

2.  **Individual Quantification:**
    * **GRT:** Group-level violations.
    * **LBA:** Person-specific bias magnitudes (e.g., Subject 35 has a `0.757` asymmetry score).

3.  **Processing Dynamics:**
    * **GRT:** Static perceptual analysis.
    * **LBA:** Dynamic processing (drift rates, decision times, noise levels).

4.  **Cognitive Architecture:**
    * **GRT:** Describes **what's** violated.
    * **LBA:** Shows **how** left and right channels interact during the decision-making process.

### 📊 Convergent Evidence Pattern

| Finding | GRT | LBA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Separability violation** | ✅ Detected | ✅ Quantified (`-0.568` correlation) |
| **Independence violation** | ✅ Detected | ✅ Mechanistic explanation |
| **Individual differences** | Limited | ✅ Full characterization |
| **Processing mechanism** | Not specified | ✅ Dual accumulator racing |

### 🎯 Key Insight
Both GRT and LBA converge on the same conclusion:
> Bilateral visuospatial processing is **NOT modular** - left and right visual channels interact systematically during perceptual decision-making.

**LBA adds the crucial "how":**
* Left and right evidence accumulators don't operate independently.
* Final decisions emerge from integrated bilateral processing.
* Individual differences reflect different patterns of this channel interaction.

### 💡 Theoretical Implications
Your findings challenge the modular brain hypothesis for visuospatial processing:

* **Classical view:** The left hemisphere processes the right visual field independently.
* **Your evidence:** Bilateral integration is the norm, not independence.
* **Clinical relevance:** Spatial deficits may reflect problems with integration, not just unilateral damage.

The LBA analysis provides the cognitive mechanism underlying the GRT violations you observed! 🎯
